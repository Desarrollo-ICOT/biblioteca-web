# 📘 Student Activity Instructions – Responsive Library Web Page

## 🎯 Objective

In this activity, you will create a simple, responsive web interface for a library system using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This will serve as the front-end of a future project connected to a backend with a database of books, students, and loans.

## 🧩 Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. **Open the project template**
Start by accessing the template we’ve prepared for you:

🔗 **GitHub Repository**:  
[https://github.com/Desarrollo-ICOT/biblioteca-web](https://github.com/Desarrollo-ICOT/biblioteca-web)

You can:
- Click the green **"Code"** button → **Download ZIP**, then extract it to work locally.  
- **OR fork/clone the repository** using Git if you're comfortable with Git workflows.

### 2. **Preview the live version**
Use the online demo as a reference or testing tool:

🌐 **CodePen Demo**:  
https://codepen.io/sonitachan81/pen/xbbBYdd

### 3. **What you should do**
- Modify the HTML structure (`index.html`) to display a responsive list of books or students.
- Apply styles using CSS (`style.css`) to make the layout adapt to different screen sizes.
- Use JavaScript (`script.js`) to:
  - Load and display data dynamically from a JSON or XML structure.
  - Create, modify, or delete elements from the DOM.
  - Change styles dynamically.

### 4. **Advanced (Optional)**
Prepare the structure so that it could **connect to a backend** in the future (e.g. when loading books from a database).

## 📌 Tips

- Make sure your layout works on both desktop and mobile screens (use `media queries`).
- Focus on semantic HTML elements (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, etc.).
- Add `meta`, `title`, `alt` attributes and use proper headings for **SEO best practices**.
- You’ll work with JSON data in the upcoming lessons, so get comfortable with `fetch()`.

## ✅ Deliverable

By the end of this activity, you should have:
- A responsive webpage that loads and displays sample data.
- Dynamic features (e.g. add/remove book entries).
- Clean code following semantic and responsive best practices.
